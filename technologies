üß± Recommended Tech Stack
‚úÖ Frontend (Client Side)
Framework: Next.js (App Router) ‚Äî fast, SEO-friendly, and full-stack capable.

UI Library: Tailwind CSS ‚Äî highly customizable, responsive UI with clean design.

Component System: Shadcn/UI ‚Äî for beautiful prebuilt components like tables, modals, inputs.

Form Management: react-hook-form + zod for validation.

‚úÖ Backend / API / Auth
Backend-as-a-Service: Supabase

Database (PostgreSQL)

File storage (for user images)

Auth (admin login)

Realtime and serverless functions (if needed)

Alternative (if you want to host your own backend): Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (but Supabase will save you time).

‚úÖ Database
Supabase PostgreSQL

Perfect for relational data like users & subscriptions.

Includes Row Level Security (RLS) for fine-grained access control.

‚úÖ Image Upload
Supabase Storage (best if using Supabase already)

Alternatives: Cloudinary or UploadThing (with Next.js API routes)

‚úÖ Admin-Only Access
Use Supabase Auth roles (e.g., restrict dashboard routes to logged-in admins).

‚úÖ Deployment
Vercel (best for Next.js, supports server functions)

Supabase (handles backend, DB, auth, and storage)

üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure Example (Next.js App Router)
bash
Copy
Edit
/app
  /admin
    /login
    /dashboard
    /user/[id]
  /form (public gym member form)
  /api (for custom endpoints if needed)
/components
  Header.jsx, Table.jsx, Filters.jsx, Modals.jsx
/lib
  supabaseClient.js
  utils.js
üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations
Use Supabase RLS to ensure only admins can:

View all users

Edit or delete

Access subscription data

Never expose sensitive keys on client side.

Validate all inputs (client and server).
